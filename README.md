# Project03: Pbstory

In project03 the skills I wanted to learn were *creating a scrollytelling webpage and utilizing ai2html*.
I also wanted to try *scraping*, but I wanted the main focus of the project to be on *building visual elements differently* than I had done in previous projects.

I did the groundwork for this project at the beginning of Lede: I completed Aaron's homework using PowerPoint. That homework aimed to practice creating a map and layer storytelling â€“ essentially a precursor to scrollytelling on a webpage. So, before I began with Project03: Pbstory, I had done the legwork, collecting data from Prospect Heights' stores. I had also created an Excel sheet from the data and done a simple map in Illustrator.

### Information Gathering and Processing

The Jupyter notebooks (pbdata + morepbdata), where I processed one of my tables (pbmapdatanew, df), are included in the repo. After Jeremy's tidy-data lectures, it should have been easier, but I definitely need more (more, more, more) practice!

At this point, I must mention that I originally intended to make a piece about how [marathon results](https://aims-worldrunning.org/statistics/world_fastest_times/2024.html#world-fastest-times) [have evolved](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20823734/these-are-the-worlds-fastest-marathoners-and-marathon-courses/), specially 2000-2024. I wanted to see if there have been noticeable changes in the times of all major marathons after the introduction of a new type of shoe; the so-called 'bouncy shoe' (year 2020). I scraped data for that, but I realized that the data manipulation would have taken so much work, and I didn't want it to consume my time. I found a simpler page and data a bout [marathon result progression](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20823734/these-are-the-worlds-fastest-marathoners-and-marathon-courses/) and scraped that and cleaned it but then there was no story to tell since data did not provide an answer to my original question.
However, I did some scraping with beautiful soup, which was a skill I initially wanted to test in this project. 

### Viz and HTML

I had already created a map for peanut butter stores. Now, I made refinements and, above all, constructed the map so that I could make it into a scrollytelling format. I also used ai2html in the jar graphic, which I rebuilt multiple times in Illustrator. Now it's scalable for different screens. I wish I had time to add interactivity...

I took the photos myself in a nearby store and at home, and I processed them in Photoshop. I also spent time on the color scheme of the story, which I changed from the initial plan: I thought the theme "Brat" was fitting, so I used colors and fonts related to this theme.

For the website layout, I combined Soman's [templates](https://jsoma.github.io/page-templates/), particularly [this](https://jsoma.github.io/page-templates/scrolly-ai2html/index.html).
