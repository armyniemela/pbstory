# Project03: Pbstory

In project03 the skills I wanted to learn were *creating a scrollytelling webpage and utilizing ai2html*.
I also wanted to try *scraping*, but I wanted the main focus of the project to be on *building visual elements differently* than I had done in previous projects.

I did the groundwork for this project at the beginning of Lede: I completed Aaron's exercise 3: Make a "Slide Story" using PowerPoint. So, before I began with Project03: Pbstory, I had done the legwork, collecting data from Prospect Heights' stores. I had also created an Excel sheet from the data and done a simple map in Illustrator.

### Data or not? 

I originally intended to make a piece about how [marathon results](https://aims-worldrunning.org/statistics/world_fastest_times/2024.html#world-fastest-times) [have evolved](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20823734/these-are-the-worlds-fastest-marathoners-and-marathon-courses/), specially 2000-2024. I wanted to see if there have been noticeable changes in the times of all major marathons after the introduction of a new type of running shoe, the bouncy super shoe year 2020. I scraped data for that, but I realized that the data manipulation would have taken so much work, and I didn't want it to consume my time. I found a simpler page and data a bout [marathon result progression](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20823734/these-are-the-worlds-fastest-marathoners-and-marathon-courses/) and scraped that and cleaned it but then there was no story to tell since data did not provide an answer to my original question.
However, I did some scraping with beautiful soup, which was a skill I initially wanted to test in this project.

The Jupyter notebooks (pbdata + morepbdata), where I processed my tables (pbmapdatanew, df), are included in the repo.

### Viz and brat

I constructed the map in Illustrator so that I could make it into a scrollytelling format. I also used ai2html in the jar graphic, which I rebuilt multiple times in Illustrator. Now it's scalable for different screens. I wish I had taken the time to do D3 (brand names popping from jars) but I did D3 in my other project, [Powernetwork](https://armyniemela.github.io/powernetwork/).

I took the photos myself in a nearby store and at home, and I processed them in Photoshop. I thought the theme "Brat" was fitting here and the color scheme fits my subject. Also, while the word “brat” usually evokes feelings of school angst, brat summer is all about accepting your imperfections while embracing the chaos. I think this describes my summer - after all, I am back in school, feeling anxious about learning new stuff but at the same time enjoying the state of irresponsibility, far from my usual everyday life.
