# Project03: Pbstory


I did the groundwork for this project at the beginning of Lede: I completed Aaron's homework using PowerPoint, which aimed to practice creating a map in Illustrator and layer storytelling â€“ essentially a precursor to scrollytelling. So, I had done the legwork, collecting data from stores. I had also created an Excel sheet from the data.

The purpose of this project is to move beyond the preliminary stage. The skills I wanted to learn included creating a scrollytelling webpage and utilizing ai2html.

### Information Gathering and Processing

The Jupyter notebooks (pbdata + morepbdata), where I processed one of my tables (pbmapdatanew, df), are included in the repo. After Jeremy's tidy-data lectures, it should have been easier, but I definitely need more (more, more, more) practice!

At this point, I must mention that I originally intended to make a piece about how marathon results have evolved in the 2000s. I even scraped data for that, but I realized that the data manipulation would have taken the most time, and I didn't want it to consume too much time. However, I did try scraping, which was a skill I initially wanted to test in this project.

### Viz and HTML

I had already created a map for peanut butter stores. Now, I made refinements and, above all, constructed the map so that I could make it into a scrollytelling format. I also used ai2html in the jar graphic, which I rebuilt multiple times in Illustrator. Now it's scalable for different screens. I wish I had time to add interactivity...

I took the photos myself in a nearby store and at home, and I processed them in Photoshop. I also spent time on the color scheme of the story, which I changed from the initial plan: I thought the theme "Brat" was fitting, so I used colors and fonts related to this theme.

For the website layout, I combined Soman's templates, particularly this: https://jsoma.github.io/page-templates/scrolly-ai2html/index.html
