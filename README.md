# Project03: Pbstory

In project03 the skills I wanted to learn were *creating a scrollytelling webpage and utilizing ai2html*.
I also wanted to *scrape*, but I wanted the main focus of the project to be on *building visual elements differently* than I had done in previous projects.

I did the groundwork for this project at the beginning of Lede: Aaron's exercise 3, Make a Slide Story. So I had done the legwork, collecting peanut butter brand data from Prospect Heights' stores and also putting the stores on a map (Mapbox, Datawrapper, Illustrator).

My idea was to map out the peanut butter selection in stores near me. The background is that I really like peanut butter, and during my previous visits to the USA, I was amazed by the wide variety available there—and I've missed that in Finland.

### Marathon vs peanut butter 

I originally intended to make a piece about how [marathon results](https://aims-worldrunning.org/statistics/world_fastest_times/2024.html#world-fastest-times) have evolved. I wanted to see what kind of changes there have been in the fastest times of all major marathons after the introduction of a special running shoe type, the bouncy "super shoe" year 2020. The shoes are mentioned as one major reason why both men and women have improved marathon world records. 

I scraped data for that (50 best M & F times 2000-2024), but I realized that the data manipulation would have taken so much work, and I didn't want it to consume my time. I found a simpler page and data a bout [marathon result progression](https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20823734/these-are-the-worlds-fastest-marathoners-and-marathon-courses/) and scraped that and cleaned it but then there was no story to tell since data did not provide an answer to my original question.
However, I did some scraping with beautiful soup, which was a skill I initially wanted to test in this project.

The Jupyter notebooks (pbdata + morepbdata), where I processed my tables (pbmapdatanew, df), are included in the repo. The dataset is, of course, very small compared to what was collected for marathon times.

### Viz and brat

I constructed the pb map in Illustrator so that I could make it into a scrollytelling format. I also used ai2html in the jar graphic, which I rebuilt multiple times in Illustrator. Now it's scalable for different screens. I wish I had taken the time to do D3 (brand names popping from jars) but I did D3 in my other project, [Powernetwork](https://armyniemela.github.io/powernetwork/).

I took the photos myself in a nearby store and at home, and I processed them in Photoshop. I thought the theme "Brat" was fitting here and the color scheme fits my subject. Also, while the word “brat” usually evokes feelings of school angst, brat summer is all about accepting your imperfections while embracing the chaos. I think this describes my summer - after all, I am back in school, feeling anxious about learning new stuff but at the same time enjoying the state of irresponsibility, far from my usual everyday life.
